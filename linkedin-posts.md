## Post 1: Introduction Post [PUBLISHED]

```
We asked 50 teachers one question:

"How many hours do you spend on admin work each week?"

Average answer: 12 hours.

That's 12 hours not spent teaching.
12 hours of lesson plans, question papers, grading, reports.

What if AI could give those hours back?

That's why we built Eulean AI.

We run workshops where teachers don't just learn about AI—they build tools they use the next day.

One teacher told us:
"I created a GPT that writes question papers in MY format. What took 3 hours now takes 10 minutes."

AI won't replace teachers.
But teachers using AI will outperform those who don't.

We're booking workshops for Jan-Mar 2025.

If your school is ready to give teachers their time back, let's talk.

## Post 2: Thought Leadership (Week 2)

```
Unpopular opinion:

Most "AI workshops" for schools are a waste of time.

Here's what usually happens:
- Someone shows a PowerPoint about ChatGPT
- Students nod along
- Everyone forgets by next week

Here's what should happen:
- Teachers BUILD a GPT trained on their syllabus
- Students CREATE an AI app they can show parents
- Everyone leaves with something they'll actually use

The difference?

Theory vs. Implementation.

We've trained teachers who went from "AI will replace us" to "How did we work without this?"

The shift happens when they build something real.

If your school's AI training has been surface-level, maybe it's time for a different approach.

## Post 3: Story-Based (Week 3)

```
Last month, a Math teacher asked me:

"I understand AI. But I have 180 students, 6 classes, and zero extra time. How do I actually use this?"

Fair question.

So we sat down. In 45 minutes, she:

1. Built a Custom GPT trained on her Class 10 syllabus
2. Generated 20 MCQs with solutions in 2 minutes
3. Created a lesson plan template she can reuse all year

Her reaction: "Why didn't anyone show me this before?"

That's the gap we're filling at Eulean AI.

Not AI awareness. AI implementation.
Not what AI can do. What AI can do for YOU.

If your teachers are curious about AI but don't know where to start, we should talk.

## Post 4: Data/Stats Hook (Week 4)

```
3 numbers that should worry every school leader:

85% of students already use AI for homework
12% of teachers feel confident using AI in class
0 schools have a clear AI policy

The gap between student AI use and teacher AI readiness is growing every semester.

Students aren't waiting for permission.

The question isn't whether AI enters your school.
It's whether your teachers are ready when it does.

We help schools close this gap—through workshops that give teachers real AI skills, not just awareness.

## Post 5: Behind the Name (Week 5)

```
Why "Eulean"?

We're named after Leonhard Euler—the 18th-century mathematician who invented graph theory.

Euler solved the famous "Seven Bridges of Königsberg" problem by finding a path that connects all points.

That's exactly what we do for schools.

We connect teachers to AI tools that save them hours.
We connect students to personalized learning.
We find the path that works for YOUR school.

Just like Euler found elegant solutions to complex problems, we help schools navigate the AI revolution—not with hype, but with practical implementation.

Connecting every learner to knowledge.

## Post 6: Workshop Results (Use after first workshop)

```
Just wrapped up a workshop at [School Name].

The results:

- 20 teachers trained
- 20 Custom GPTs created (one per teacher)
- Average time saved per week: 4+ hours

But the best moment?

A senior teacher—35 years of experience—said:

"I was scared AI would make me obsolete. Now I realize it just makes me faster."

That mindset shift is worth more than any tool.

If your school is ready to move from AI anxiety to AI adoption, let's talk.
